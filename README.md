# CSV Data Analysis Project

## Overview

The **CSV Data Analysis Project** is an advanced Python-based application designed for interactive analysis of employee records stored in a CSV file. This application leverages LangChain's thought-action framework, allowing an autonomous agent to **interpret problem statements, generate and execute code, and evaluate results** without manual input. This feature minimizes the need for developer-written code, making it highly efficient for streamlined data analysis and insights.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project includes key components that facilitate automated data handling and analysis. The LangChain agent forms the core, managing thought-action pipelines, code generation, and result verification.

### Main Components
1. **app.py**: The main entry point that initializes the Streamlit interface and connects the LangChain agent for autonomous operations.
2. **utils.py**: Houses data utilities and helper functions for various data manipulations and aggregations.
3. **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies needed for the project.
4. **employees.csv**: The primary dataset representing employee records for analysis.
5. **.env** and **.env.example**: Configuration files for managing sensitive data, including API keys for any external integrations.

### High-Level Workflow
1. **User Interface**: Built with Streamlit, it provides an interactive interface for data input and result display.
2. **LangChain Agent**: The agent interprets user prompts and problem statements, generates code dynamically, executes the code, and verifies the results autonomously.
3. **Data Processing Pipeline**: `utils.py` supports the agent by performing specific data transformations, while CSV data is loaded for analysis.
4. **Configuration Management**: Environment variables from `.env` control configurations and ensure secure handling of sensitive information.

## Key Feature: Autonomous Code Generation

This application is powered by LangChain’s agent, allowing it to analyze natural language problem statements, generate necessary code, execute it, and return results—all without requiring explicit code. This **self-coding, self-assessing process** is highly efficient for rapid data insights and frees developers from writing analysis scripts manually.

## Technologies and Libraries

- **LangChain (v0.1.13)**: Manages the thought-action cycles, providing the autonomous agent functionality.
- **Streamlit (v1.29.0)**: Framework for an interactive web application, enabling easy interaction with data.
- **OpenAI (v1.14.2)**: Allows integration with OpenAI's API, if additional NLP processing or analysis is needed.
- **tiktoken (v0.5.2)**: Tokenization library used for NLP tasks.
- **python-dotenv (v1.0.1)**: Manages environment variables for secure API handling.
- **tabulate (v0.9.0)**: Formats tabular data for clean display.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd csv-data-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set required values.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

Upon launching, the application allows you to:

- **Upload Data**: Load new CSV files for analysis.
- **Filter and Explore**: Filter records by department, role, or other attributes.
- **Automated Insights**: Request insights, which the LangChain agent interprets, generates relevant code, and provides results.
- **Natural Language Analysis**: *(Optional)* If configured, the app uses OpenAI to analyze trends or generate natural language summaries.

## Configuration Options

Environment settings are managed in the `.env` file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI services.
- `DEBUG_MODE`: Enables debug logging for troubleshooting.

## Testing

To test this project:

```bash
pytest
```

The modular design of `utils.py` allows testing individual functions for reliability.
