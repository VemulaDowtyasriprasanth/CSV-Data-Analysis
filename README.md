CSV Data Analysis Project
Overview
The CSV Data Analysis Project is a Python application designed for interactive analysis of employee data stored in CSV files. It leverages LangChain’s framework, allowing an autonomous agent to interpret user queries, generate and execute code, and verify results without manual scripting. This functionality enables rapid, efficient data analysis.

Architecture
The project’s architecture includes key components that facilitate automated data handling and analysis. At its core, a LangChain agent manages task orchestration, handling user prompts, code generation, and result verification.

Key Components
app.py: Initializes the Streamlit interface and connects to the LangChain agent, setting up the application’s main functions.
utils.py: Contains helper functions and utilities for data manipulation and aggregation.
requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies required for the project.
employees.csv: Primary dataset containing employee records for analysis.
.env and .env.example: Configuration files for securely managing environment variables, such as API keys.
Workflow
User Interface: Built with Streamlit, offering an interactive front end for data input and display.
LangChain Agent: Interprets user queries, dynamically generates code, executes it, and verifies results.
Data Processing Pipeline: Utilities in utils.py handle data transformation and processing.
Configuration Management: Environment variables in .env control configurations and securely manage sensitive information.
Key Feature: Autonomous Code Generation
The main feature of this project is its autonomous code generation capability. The LangChain agent enables the app to interpret natural language problem statements, generate code automatically, execute it, and return results—all without user-generated code. This setup provides fast data insights and removes the need for manually written analysis scripts.

Technologies and Libraries
LangChain: Manages thought-action cycles, providing autonomous functionality to the agent.
Streamlit: Framework for creating an interactive web application.
OpenAI (Optional): Allows integration with OpenAI’s API for enhanced NLP processing.
tiktoken: Tokenization library for NLP tasks.
python-dotenv: Manages environment variables securely.
tabulate: Formats tabular data for clean display.
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

Use the command git clone <repository-url> and navigate to the project directory with cd csv-data-analysis.
Install dependencies:

Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all necessary packages.
Configure environment variables:

Copy .env.example to .env and set required values. You can do this with:
bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Run the application:

Start the application by executing streamlit run app.py.
Usage
After launching, the application provides the following features:

Upload Data: Load new CSV files for analysis.
Filter and Explore: Filter records by department, role, or other attributes.
Automated Insights: Request insights; the LangChain agent interprets, generates relevant code, and provides results.
Natural Language Analysis (Optional): If configured, the app uses OpenAI to analyze trends or generate summaries.
Configuration Options
Settings are managed in the .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY: Your API key for OpenAI services.
DEBUG_MODE: Enables debug logging for troubleshooting.
Testing
To test the project, simply run:

bash
Copy code
pytest
The modular design of utils.py allows for testing individual functions to ensure reliability.
