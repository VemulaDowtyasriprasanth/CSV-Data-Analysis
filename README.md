CSV Data Analysis Project
Overview
The CSV Data Analysis Project is a Python application built to enable interactive analysis of employee data stored in CSV files. This application uses LangChain’s framework, allowing an autonomous agent to interpret user queries, generate and execute code, and verify results automatically. This feature removes the need for manual scripting, making data analysis rapid and efficient.

Architecture
The project’s architecture includes key components that facilitate automated data handling and analysis. At its core is a LangChain agent, which manages task orchestration to handle user prompts, code generation, and result verification.

Key Components
app.py: Initializes the Streamlit interface and connects to the LangChain agent, setting up the application’s main functions.
utils.py: Contains helper functions and utilities for data manipulation and aggregations.
requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required for the project.
employees.csv: The primary dataset, containing employee records for analysis.
.env and .env.example: Configuration files for managing environment variables, such as API keys, securely.
Workflow
User Interface: Built with Streamlit, offering an interactive front end for data input and display.
LangChain Agent: Interprets user queries, dynamically generates code, executes it, and verifies results.
Data Processing Pipeline: Utilities in utils.py handle data transformation and processing.
Configuration Management: Environment variables from .env control configurations and enable secure handling of sensitive information.
Key Feature: Autonomous Code Generation
This project’s main feature is its autonomous code generation. The LangChain agent enables the app to interpret natural language problem statements, autonomously generate code, execute it, and provide results—all without requiring explicit coding from the user. This results in rapid data insights and eliminates the need for manually written analysis scripts.

Technologies and Libraries
LangChain: Manages thought-action cycles, providing autonomous functionality to the agent.
Streamlit: Framework for creating an interactive web application.
OpenAI: (Optional) Allows integration with OpenAI’s API for enhanced NLP processing.
tiktoken: Used for tokenization in NLP tasks.
python-dotenv: Manages environment variables securely.
tabulate: Formats tabular data for clean display.
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

Use git clone <repository-url> and navigate into the project directory with cd csv-data-analysis.
Install dependencies:

Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all necessary packages.
Configure environment variables:

Copy .env.example to .env and set required values. This can be done with:
bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Run the application:

Start the application by executing streamlit run app.py.
Usage
Once launched, the application allows you to:

Upload Data: Load new CSV files for analysis.
Filter and Explore: Filter records by department, role, or other attributes.
Automated Insights: Request insights; the LangChain agent interprets, generates relevant code, and provides results.
Natural Language Analysis: (Optional) If configured, the app uses OpenAI to analyze trends or create summaries.
Configuration Options
Settings are managed in the .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY: Your API key for OpenAI services.
DEBUG_MODE: Enables debug logging for troubleshooting.
Testing
To test the project, simply run:

Copy code
pytest
The modular design of utils.py allows for testing individual functions to ensure reliability.
